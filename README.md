# beta_bank_churn
Beta-Bank clients began to terminate bank terms every month and stopped using the bankâ€™s services. Banking management wants to figure out whether it is cheaper to keep current customers or to attract new ones.  The task is to build a model in order to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. A historical data about customer behavior and termination of agreements with the bank provided for analysis and modelling.
