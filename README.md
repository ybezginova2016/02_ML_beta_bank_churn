## Project Description

Beta Bank Case: Will The Existing Client Withdraw the Contracts for Bank Services?

Beta-Bank clients began to terminate bank terms every month and stopped using the bankâ€™s services. Banking management wants to figure out whether it is cheaper to keep current customers or to attract new ones.  The task is to build a model in order to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. A historical data about customer behavior and termination of agreements with the bank provided for analysis and modelling.

## Project Goal
The task for the project is to predict whether existing Beta Bank's clients are going to stop using the bank services in upcoming future.

## Data
There is an archived data given, including the data about contracts withdrawal by the current clients.

## Project Methodology
To build a machine learning model with a maximun F1-score (at least F1-score = 0.59). The model is to be tested on the test data.
To measure AUC-ROC score and compare it with F1-score.
